# ControlSHAP

Code for the submission, "Stabilizing Estimates of Shapley Values with Control Variates." The dependencies for our core methods, in HelperFiles/, are numpy and statsmodels. Our simulations and analysis also use matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, scipy, pickle, Pytorch, [sage](https://github.com/iancovert/sage/), and [shap](https://github.com/shap/shap).
